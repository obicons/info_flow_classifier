This PR partly resurrects #16501 and introduces the use of principals object to associate objects and Realms with origins. Using this infrastructure, this PR implements [the custom internal methods][1] of the `Location` interface, which is "maybe-cross-origin".

Unimplemented/incomplete things:

 - Other maybe-cross-origin interfaces, namely `WindowProxy` and `DissimilarWindowLocation`, aren't implemented correctly yet (causing most test cases of `tests/wpt/web-platform-tests/html/browsers/origin/cross-origin-objects/cross-origin-objects.html` to fail). 
     - `WindowProxy`: #28556
 - [The "perform a security check" operation][2] and `Location`'s non-cross-origin properties' relevant `Document` origin checks aren't implemented either (not sure if they are covered by the existing tests).
 - There are a slight deviation from the standard and inefficiency in `CrossOriginGetOwnPropertyHelper`'s current implementation. 
     - #28557
