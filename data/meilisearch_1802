Describe the bug
With the release of 0.23 we can use the new Geo Search feature. I tried to add `_geo` as a filterable attribute but it's not working. With the MeiliSearch API I can add all other attributes but `_geo` is not working. Seems the API is blocking underscores.

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Create a post call to `/indexes/:index_uid/settings/filterable-attributes`
Add `"_geo"'` as attribute in you post call
Create a get call to `/indexes/:index_uid/settings/filterable-attributes`
`_geo` is not added here
Expected behavior
`_geo` should be added as filterable attribute.

MeiliSearch version:
0.23.0
