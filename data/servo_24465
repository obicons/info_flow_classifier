yes
Spec: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#dom-offscreencanvas-width

#24464 adds width and height members, but these are duplicated from the ones stored in the associated OffscreenCanvas. We should do the following:

remove the duplicate members
remove the Option from OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D's canvas member, since there is always an associated canvas
use the associated canvas' size when necessary
when OffscreenCanvas's SetWidth or SetHeight methods are called, send a CanvasMsg::Recreate message to the canvas paint thread (see CanvasRenderingContext2D::set_bitmap_dimensions for a model, called from HTMLCanvasElement::recreate_contexts)
@bblanke This would be a good task for your group to work on. It should allow some more tests to pass, too.
