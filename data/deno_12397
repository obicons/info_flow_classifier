I'm currently trying to use Deno.emit to get some typescript (+TSX syntax) transpiled to javascript to be used by a browser. My current setup is the following:

```
 const { files, diagnostics } = await Deno.emit("./app/typescript/application.ts", {
    check: true,
    importMapPath: ...
    importMap: ...,
    compilerOptions: {
      module: "es6",
      target: "es6",
      sourceMap: false
    },
  });
```
It all works great (thank you for it!) except that the import lines are pretty much left unchanged, resulting in:

application.ts:
```
import { plus } from "./util.ts";
console.log(plus(1, 2, 2));
util.ts:

export const plus = (a: number, b: number, c: number) => a + b + c
```
being transpiled to:

application.js:
```
import { plus } from "./util.ts";
console.log(plus(1, 2, 2));
```
util.js:
```
export const plus = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
```
which I found problematic, because the import in the javascript file application.js still points to the typescript file util.ts

Is this working as intended, or could this be fixable? I'm happy to contribute a fix for it, but I wanted to first check if this was something that you were interested in changing!
