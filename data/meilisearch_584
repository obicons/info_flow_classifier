yes
Private key is described in the documentation the following way :

The Private key grants access to all routes except the /keys routes.
When trying out every route with the private key I stumbled upon an error on the
GET /version route.

the key given in the example below is the private key of my Meilisearch Server.

$ curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/version' -H 'X-MEILI-API-KEY: 8c222193c4dff5a19689d637416820bc623375f2ad4c31a2e3a76e8f4c70440d ' | jq

{
  "message": "Invalid API key: 8c222193c4dff5a19689d637416820bc623375f2ad4c31a2e3a76e8f4c70440d"
}
Is this the desired behavior? In which case the documentation should be changed to be in line with this behavior.

EDIT
This is also the case for the following routes:
GET /stats
GET /sys-info
GET /sys-info/pretty
Private key has access to none of those routes.
