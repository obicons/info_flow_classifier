```
Seems like the tarball isn't being updated, while the shasum is?

Shasum today is `e2b0202ba7d8aad2ab6e2dc32e556fca58ed9ca3256e8335c76a392d2631da6f`, yesterday it was `6e16a478a56ae57ba3377df9ffc3373abf07fe70ab2511d87e41e5e05443ce1b`

Tried with MacOS version and it was fine. Not sure if this is the right place to raise the issue, but I thought it's worth bringing some attention to it.
